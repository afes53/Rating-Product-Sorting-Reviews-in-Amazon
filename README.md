Business Problem

Correctly calculating the points awarded to products after sales is a crucial issue in e-commerce. Solving this problem leads to increased customer satisfaction, improved product visibility for sellers, and a seamless shopping experience for buyers. Additionally, ensuring the accurate ordering of product comments is another important challenge. Misleading comments can directly impact product sales, resulting in financial and customer losses.
